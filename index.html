              <p>Born Augusta Ada Byron on December 10, 1815, the daughter of the famous poet Lord Byron and later Countess of Lovelace, Ada was a mathematician ahead of her time.
                She is chiefy famous for her work on Charles Babbage's early 'computer', the Analytical Engine.
                Though the Analytical Engine was not constructed until 1941, nearly 90 years <em>after</em> death,
                Ada was one of the first to recognize the amazing potential of computing and is believed to have published
                one of the algorithms.
